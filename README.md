# image_projection
## Overview
image_projection is a [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) package to create various projections from multiple calibrated cameras. Use cases involve:

 - Rectify a distorted image
 - Create a cylindrical projection (equirectangular, mercator ..) from 360° camera data from multiple cameras
 - Create a perspective (pinhole) projection from fisheye camera data
 - Convert non-linear fisheye data to an ideal fisheye lense ("tru-theta")
 - Define a virtual pan-tilt camera

Available projection targets are:

 - Pinhole / perspective projection
 - Mercator projection
 - Ideal fisheye projection

Projections can be created periodically or on-demand. All projection parameters including image dimensions and position/direction can be configured dynamically at runtime. All cameras have to be calibrated beforehand.

A demo launch configuration is available below.

## Installation
If you haven't already installed it, [install ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu). Please use **Desktop-Full Install** to run the demo. Noetic is officially supported, but Melodic and Kinetic should work as well.

[Create a new catkin workspace](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html). Skip this step if you use your existing workspace. 
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws/
catkin init
```

Go into the source directory of your workspace and check out image_projection
```
cd src/
git clone https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/image_projection.git
```

Install dependencies via rosdep and wstool (.rosinstall)
```
cd image_projection
rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
wstool init ../.. # not required if already initialized
wstool merge image_projection_https.rosinstall
wstool update
```
Build
```
catkin build image_projection_demo
```
and source the workspace
```
source ../../devel/setup.bash
```
Verify your installation by launching the demo (see below).

## Getting started

### Launching the demo
Make sure to open a new terminal after building the project for the first time.

Start by downloading the demo bag file with
```
roscd image_projection_demo/bags/
wget https://www.sim.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/~oehler/insta360_air_robocup2018.bag
```
Launch the demo with
```
roslaunch image_projection_demo demo_insta360.launch
```
An [rqt](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt) window with the source video and projection examples will open. The [rqt_reconfigure](http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_reconfigure) GUI on the right side can be used to change projection parameters at runtime.

### Setting up your own projection
To use image_projection for your robot, you will need to update camera topics, calibration and projection parameters. You can duplicate the launch and configuration files in the demo and adapt them to your robot.

The main launch file is `image_projection_demo/launch/projections.launch`. It loads the configuration, calibration and starts up the projection nodelets.
Cameras are configured in `image_projection_demo/config/camera360_cameras.yaml`. This setup uses an extended camera calibration from kalibr.
Projections are configured in `image_projection_demo/config/projections.yaml`.

Lastly, make sure that your cameras are properly calibrated. For calibration instructions, refer to the section "Camera calibration" below.

### Camera calibration
The following calibration formats are supported:

- [sensor_msgs/CameraInfo] is the ROS standard camera calibration for pinhole cameras. It can be created with [camera_calibration]. Normally, the calibration file is loaded by the camera driver and published on `/[camera_name]/camera_info`.

- [kalibr_image_geometry_msgs/ExtendedCameraInfo] is an extended calibration format with additional support for fisheye cameras. The format is based on calibrations with [kalibr]. The extended calibration can be published with the node `kalibr_extended_camera_info_publisher/camera_info_publisher_node` on topic `/[camera_name]/extended_camera_info`. You can see an example in `image_projection_demo/launch/calibration_publisher.launch`. The node needs the calibration as a YAML file, you can see the format in `image_projection_demos/config/insta360_3_omni_radtan_calibration/camera360_right.yaml`. The information has to be filled in from the kalibr calibration file.

## Insights
### Method
image_projection projects multiple cameras onto 3D projection surfaces. The shapes of the projection surfaces are parameterized and depend on the chosen projection. A pinhole projection uses a planar projection surfaces, cylindrical projections, e.g. Mercator, use, as the name suggests, a cylindrical surface.
The surfaces are generated inside the scene with a pixel grid of the chosen target resolution. Each surface pixel is projected into every camera to retrieve color information. If the projected pixel is valid (inside the image) in more than one camera, the best match is chosen based on a heuristic. Pixels close to the respective image center are preferred.

Initially, a projection map is computed as described above. This step is rather costly and has to be repeated each time parameters are changed. The projection itself is comparatively cheap and implemented as a remap for each camera onto the same target image.

### Stitching Seams
Typically, projections with multiple camera sources show stitching seams. These seams are due to the fact, that camera centers to not coincide. With a wider baseline between the two cameras, more artifacts will be visible. Reversely, stitching quality improves if baselines are small. The effect can be mitigated by moving the projection surface to the typical distance of surrounding objects. Another common approach to eliminate stitching seams is blending, which might get integrated in the future. However, this can lead to ghosting artifacts.


## Nodes (Nodelets)
All nodes also come in nodelet variants (name in brackets) and are implemented as lazy subscribers.
### periodic_image_projection_node (image_projection/PeriodicImageProjectionNodelet)
This node/nodelet periodically publishes a projected image from the latest camera data. All projection parameters can be configured dynamically at runtime. No computation is performed, if the output topic is not subscribed.
#### Subscribed Topics

### image_projection_server_node
*Not yet implemented.* This node creates projections on-demand as a service.

## Projection plugins
Projections are implemented as [plugins](https://wiki.ros.org/pluginlib). The following plugins are available:
### image_projection_plugins::PinholeProjection
Creates a virtual perspective (pinhole) camera by creating a 3D plane. The camera points towards the x-axis in the camera frame and towards the z-axis in the optical frame (ROS standard).
#### Parameters
* **`~projection_parameters/focal_length`** (double, 1.0)

    Focal length of the simulated pinhole camera in meters.
* **`~projection_parameters/horizontal_fov`** (double, 90.0)

    Horizontal field of view in degree. Vertical field of view is calculated based on aspect ratio to enforce square pixels.
#### Published Topics
* **`~camera_info`** ([sensor_msgs/CameraInfo])

    Camera info of the generated pinhole projection.

### image_projection_plugins::MercatorProjection
The Mercator projection creates a virtual 3D cylinder projection surface.
#### Parameters
* **`~projection_parameters/cylinder_radius`** (double, 1.0)

    Radius of the cylinder in meters.
* **`~projection_parameters/vertical_fov`** (double, 1.0)

    Vertical field of view of the projection. This determines the height of the cylinder.
### image_projection_plugins::IdealFisheyeProjection
Generates an ideal ("tru-theta") fisheye image by creating a 3D sphere. An ideal fisheye image has a linear relationship between pixel distance from image center to corresponding light ray. Most real fisheye lenses do not achieve this.
#### Parameters
* **`~projection_parameters/sphere_radius`** (double, 1.0)

    Radius of the sphere in meters.
* **`~projection_parameters/fov`** (double, 1.0)
